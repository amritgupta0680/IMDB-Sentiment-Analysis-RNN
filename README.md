# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis-RNN

A **Deep Learning–based Sentiment Analysis project** that classifies IMDB movie reviews as **positive or negative** using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**.

---

## 📌 Project Description
This project focuses on understanding user sentiment from movie reviews by leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Recurrent Neural Networks**.  
The model learns sequential patterns in text data to accurately predict the sentiment of unseen reviews.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of:
- Text preprocessing
- Sequence modeling
- Neural network training
- Model evaluation
